# Workshop Notebooks

This repository contains notebooks for two workshops designed to introduce new coders to Python and, have a deeper look at useful data-science packages like Pandas. The worksho is split into two parts, detailed below:

1. **Python Basics:** This walks users thorugh the basics of python, going from variables and operators all the way up to coding environments and third party packages. This section is split accross four notebooks:
    * `1-Data Types and Operators.ipynb` explores the different types of data Python can handle, and how they can be manipulated with operators.
    * `2-Loops and Logic.ipynb` interoduces the idea of `for` loops and logical operators like `if` and `else` to build more complex programmes. 
    * `3-Functions.ipynb` looks at how we build reusable, testable blocks of code using functions, and how we improve usability with documentation. 
    * `4-Packages and Environments.ipynb` shows how to build a reproducible coding environment, and use third party packages for complex coding projects. 


2. **Hands of Pandas:** This workshop was developed by [Stef Molin](https://github.com/stefmolin/pandas-workshop) and provides users with an interactive exploration of Pandas - a third party Python package used extensively in data science. Each section contains exercises, which can be completed in the `workbook.ipynb` notebook. The course is split across four notebooks:
    * `1-getting_started_with_pandas.ipynb` introduces the idea of a *DataFrame* and explores some of the ways we can interact with them. 
    * `2-data_wrangling.ipynb` looks at how we can clean, structure and manipulate dataframes using Pandas built in methods.
    * `3-data_visualization.ipynb` explores the different ways we can visualize our datasets using Pandas.
    * `4-hands_on_data_analysis.ipynb` provides a mini data analysis project for users to try out their skills. 


**NOTES**:  `0-check_your_env.ipynb` should be run initially to check your setup. The code in `check_env.py` is required for this check to work, as is the file `environment.yml` - don't make any changes to these files!
