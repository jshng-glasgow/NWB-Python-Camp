    "\n",
    "Third party packages are libraries which are not included in the base Python installation. To use them we must first install them on our computer using a package manager like Pip or Conda. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2.1 Creating a Conda Environment\n",
    "It is good practice to keep all the packages you need for a project in the same place, called an *environment*. Keeping our packages in a clean and minimal environment makes it easier for others to re-use our code, as they know exactly what packages to install to make it work. This is particularly important in science, where we want our code to be as reproducible as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, search for *Anconda Prompt* on your computer and open it. You should get something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](conda_prompt_1.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to note is the `(base)` before your current working directory, in this case (`C:\\Users\\jws10y>`). This is indicating that we are in our `base` environment. We could start installing software into this, however if we want to keep a track of which packages we use on different projects we need to create a project specific environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create that new environment. We'll name this environment `NWB-hackathon`. We're also going to specify the Python version we will be using for this, in this case `Python==3.11`. Do this with the following line:\n",

This environment is now a clean install of Python which we can build a coding environment on. First, though, we need to enter that environment by *activating* it. You need to do this any time you want to use the environment for coding. Enter the following line into your Anaconda Prompt: \n",

We're going to install a few commonly used data science libraries, but there are thousands of others out there. First, let's install *Jupyter* again. Since we have made a clean environment, the packages installed with Anaconda might not be on our `NWB-hackathon` environment. We'll be using `pip` to install these packages. Pip will pull all the code for Jupyter from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) - a huge repository of open-source Python code. Install Jupyter with the following command:\n",

    "Go back to your Anaconda Prompt terminal, and check that the `(NWB-hackathon)` environment is running (it should be the first thing on your current line).
